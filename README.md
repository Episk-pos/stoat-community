# Stoat Community

Welcome to the central hub for the **Episkopos** community's **Stoat** fork(s).

This repository is the source of truth for:
- 🐛 **Bug Reports**
- 💡 **Feature Requests**
- 🎨 **UX Feedback**
- 🔒 **Security Reports**

## Where To File Issues
Use **GitHub Issues** in this repository.

1. [Open `New issue`](https://github.com/Episk-pos/stoat-community/issues/new/choose)
2. Choose a template
3. Fill all required sections

Available templates:
- `Bug Report`
- `Feature Request`
- `UX Feedback`
- `Security Issue`

## Before Opening A New Issue
1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Confirm behavior on the latest available Stoat build.
3. Collect evidence:
   - Reproduction steps
   - Screenshots or video
   - Environment details (OS, client, version)
   - Logs or error messages

## Bug Reports
Good bug reports include:

1. Clear summary of the problem
2. Exact reproduction steps
3. Expected vs actual behavior
4. Frequency, severity, and workaround
5. Environment + evidence

Use the `Bug Report` template.

## Feature Requests
Strong feature requests include:

1. User problem being solved
2. Desired outcome
3. Proposed solution
4. Alternatives considered
5. Scope and impact
6. Acceptance criteria

Use the `Feature Request` template.

## UX Feedback
Use `UX Feedback` when reporting friction, confusion, or usability issues that may not be strict bugs.

Helpful UX submissions include:
- Current experience and pain points
- Suggested improvement
- Why it matters to users
- Supporting examples and references

## Security Reports
Use `Security Issue` for vulnerabilities.

If the report includes sensitive exploit details, do not post proof-of-concept details publicly. Provide impact and reproduction at a safe level so maintainers can coordinate remediation.

## Triage Flow
Maintainers will generally:

1. Validate scope and request missing information
2. Apply labels (`type`, `priority`, `severity`, `area`, `status`)
3. Deduplicate and link related issues
4. Move accepted issues into planning/in progress

Higher-quality issue submissions reduce triage turnaround time.
