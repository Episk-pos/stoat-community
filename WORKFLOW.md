# Issue Workflow

## Triage
Issues are automatically tagged based on keywords. We use labels to categorize issues.

## Development
Once an issue is accepted, it is assigned to a developer and moved to the "In Progress" column.

## Completion
When the issue is resolved, it is closed and the resolution is documented.
